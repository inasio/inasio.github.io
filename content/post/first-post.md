## Meta post

I'm very __happy__ to introduce my new website! The plan is to get back into writing, I'm not really sure what shape or form it will take. I remember as a kid the day that the coin dropped in my head on how writing represented spoken language, and specifically I remember that the first work I wrote (and proudly showed my mom) was __meta__. It's in that sense that this is the Meta post.

I took me a while to put up a website online again, this is probably overkill for a simple blog, but I did it following the instructions [here](https://fillmem.com/post/self-hosted-fast-secured-and-free-static-site/)
