      <description>I like to read books. The first real books that I ever read, just lines of words in each page, were the Sandokan books by Emilio Salgari (Salgari is probably worth writing a post or two, at the very least). I read that I could find, then read them again, and then I read them again. I remember being frustrated that by chance I had managed to luck out and start reading with world&amp;rsquo;s very best most excellent books, the frustration being that it was all going to be downhill from here.</description>
