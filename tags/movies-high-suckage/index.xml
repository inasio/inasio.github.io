      <description>I clearly remember seeing the movie Breaking the waves (dir: Von Trier), out of highschool, with an old jesuit friend. I was fucking furious at the end of it (my friend on the other hand was practically ecstatic). I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp the unfairness, the injustice of what happens to the girl in the movie, and how it was portrayed as something magical or beautiful or sacred or some shit like that.</description>
