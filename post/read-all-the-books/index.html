            <p>I like to read books. The first real books that I ever read, just lines of words in each page, were the Sandokan books by Emilio Salgari (Salgari is probably worth writing a post or two, at the very least). I read that I could find, then read them again, and then I read them again. I remember being frustrated that by chance I had managed to luck out and start reading with world&rsquo;s very best most excellent books, the frustration being that it was all going to be downhill from here. I mentioned this to my uncle Rafa, my go-to guru for all things book-related, I don&rsquo;t remember if he laughed or sighed or just tilted his head in a funny way. We were in his house where practically every single wall is covered in shelves and books, he must have looked around, and then produced a stack of books that he said would maybe come a bit close to the incredible heights of the adventures of Sandokan and his pals Tremal Naik, Kammamuri, etc.</p>

<p>I kept on reading lots, read a lot of books while in school, while my parents were driving, snuck under the sheets. I eventually got over Salgari and read basically anything I could find, including the monthly (weekly?) Readers Digest cover to cover, and even browsed the phone book in a few desperate times.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a few years (this feels like such a dated post, phone books, fast-forwarding, Readers Digest&hellip;), google was the new thing in town, I no longer had to go through Altavista, Yahoo, or even dogpile (a metasearch engine from way back). Suddenly google was sexy, had a bunch of cash and cool projects. The one that really blew my mind was google books, their plan to scan every single book. I had a revelation back then: I wanted to work for them, as my ultimate goal in life was/is/should-be to read all the books. Not necessarily meaning that it would be <strong>me</strong> reading all the books, I&rsquo;m not stupid, some of those Readers Digest were pretty bad, not keen on going there again. Maybe later I&rsquo;ll write about how to go about it&hellip;</p>
