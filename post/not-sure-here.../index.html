            <p>I clearly remember seeing the movie Breaking the waves (dir: Von Trier), out of highschool, with an old jesuit friend. I was fucking furious at the end of it (my friend on the other hand was practically ecstatic). I just couldn&rsquo;t grasp the unfairness, the injustice of what happens to the girl in the movie, and how it was portrayed as something magical or beautiful or sacred or some shit like that. I had a similar reaction to the Magical Life of Oscar Wao (au: ???) but that&rsquo;s food for another story, maybe.</p>

<p>That being said I respected the movie for generating such a strong response from me, at the time I watched way more art cinema than I do now. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a bad movie, maybe fucked-up is a better adjective. In terms of bad movies, the worst movie I&rsquo;ve ever watched was Mission Impossible 1. As with Von Trier&rsquo;s movie, this is a personal interpretation, nothing about cinematography, action scene coreography, or a particular beef with Tom Cruise. It only took me about five minutes to realize that the movie was going to hurt. See, I was a huge fan of the Mission Impossible series (does anybody remember the Mission Impossible series? Rumour has it that Tom Cruise bought the rights to the series, which might explain why it&rsquo;s never on TV, or had a remake). The MI series I watched was actually already a remake of the original one, with only Jim as the recurring character. Jim was like the George Smiley, the puppetmaster, he had a team of specialists with unique abilities (sort of like FPS characters for spy missions) which he assembled based on the requirements of the &ldquo;Impossible&rdquo; missions, and then they all got together as a team and achieved the goal or secured the package or rescued the hostage&hellip; Im MI1, the team is dead within five minutes including Jim, only Tom Cruise survives, and suddenly it&rsquo;s only about Tom Cruise doing some pointless shit without his team and without Jim, because what&rsquo;s the point? In anything a bit more honest it would have been a Ronin type of movie, maybe he manages to get revenge and immediately seppukus afterwards. But no, why was there even a team in the first place? To add (extreme) insult to injury, in the end it turns out that Jim (Jon Voight couldn&rsquo;t have been a worse pick here) was the traitor, a bad guy, a turncoat, and for the worst possible reason (I think he was bored).</p>
