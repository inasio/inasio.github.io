      <description>Meta post I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to introduce my new website! The plan is to get back into writing, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what shape or form it will take. I remember as a kid the day that the coin dropped in my head on how writing represented spoken language, and specifically I remember that the first work I wrote (and proudly showed my mom) was meta. It&amp;rsquo;s in that sense that this is the Meta post.</description>
