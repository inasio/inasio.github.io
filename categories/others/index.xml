      <description>I like to read books. The first real books that I ever read, just lines of words in each page, were the Sandokan books by Emilio Salgari (Salgari is probably worth writing a post or two, at the very least). I read that I could find, then read them again, and then I read them again. I remember being frustrated that by chance I had managed to luck out and start reading with world&amp;rsquo;s very best most excellent books, the frustration being that it was all going to be downhill from here.</description>

      <description>Goal
Distribute the given boxes into a hundred trucks so that the lightest and heaviest have the smallest possible weight difference.
Background
You are a great tycoon who needs to move materials, equipment and gold from Chicago to New York to build your next sky scraper. You have a convoy of 100 trucks and a variable amount of boxes to move. Unfortunately there are unscrupulous villains who would like to steal the gold from one of your shipments.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to introduce my new website! The plan is to get back into writing, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what shape or form it will take. I remember as a kid the day that the coin dropped in my head on how writing represented spoken language, and specifically I remember that the first work I wrote (and proudly showed my mom) was meta. It&amp;rsquo;s in that sense that this is the Meta post.</description>
